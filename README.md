# TaupeGun

The plugin was made for the spigot-1.8.8.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT-latest version.
A big thank you to UltiXstorm and yukimoki for their help on mathematical problems that I had.
Thanks also to ANerdUnicorn who helped me to create the image of the plugin.

Because without a developer, no plugin, I ask you not to remove my nickname from the tab.
