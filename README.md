If you want use the this source code or a part of this, read **LICENSE** file.

The plugin was made for the **spigot-1.8.8.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT-latest version**.
A big thank you to UltiXstorm and yukimoki for their help on mathematical problems that I had.
Thanks also to ANerdUnicorn who helped me to create the image of the plugin.
Thanks to Janeo who helped me translate this page in english and create the english translation of the plugin itself.

Because without a developer, no plugin, I ask you not to remove my nickname from the tab.
